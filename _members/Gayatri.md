Gayatriâ€™s initial training was in molecular biology but took a conscious choice to explore the field of computational structural biology during PhD. As the building blocks of life, proteins are by far the most intriguing system and provide multiple different ways to address scientific questions. She developed pipelines to identify structures of uncharacterized proteins (Domains of Unknown Functions -DUFs) and designed sequences to act as connecting links between the existing protein families and the DUFs. To advance a career in translational research she chose to do her postdoc at MD Anderson and now at Mayo developing and applying spatial tools and functions to high-plex spatial transcriptomic data of GBM patients. This helps unravel the complex tumor biology of GBM
Outside of the lab, she enjoys taking nature walks, training in classical music and writing short stories.

# Bhat lab Group

Our group uses a multipronged approach to explain the genetic, molecular and immunological basis of glioblastoma (GBM), a malignant brain cancer that is incurable.Despite aggressive standard-of-care treatments, including concurrent chemoradiation, people with GBM ultimately relapse and die of this disease. Dr. Bhat's long-term goal is to understand GBM at the molecular and cellular levels. He uses state-of-the-art technologies and applies resulting knowledge to develop new therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for individuals with brain cancer.

Bhat laboratory overarching goals. Using brain tumors as a model system, we seek to:
- Decipher  glioma stem cell biology as it relates to the therapy resistance using state of the art 3D chromatin studies as well mouse models;
- Catalog the immune landscape using deep immunophenotyping; and
- Discover new liquid biopsy approaches to longitudinally monitor disease progression.

We have a multi-disciplinary team including immunologists, clinical residents, neurobiologists and bioinformaticians who their expertise and different perspectives to examining the evolution of GBM disease and recurrence.

Rakesh Trivedi is an American Brain Tumor Association (ABTA) postdoctoral fellow with training in computational biology. Before joining Dr. Bhat’s laboratory in 2021, he earned his Ph.D. from the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) in Hyderabad, India. During his Ph.D., he developed a novel series of amino acid substitution scoring matrices specific to eukaryotic proteins enriched with disordered regions. His long-term research goal is to understand the brain cancer development and progression from genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics perspectives by implementing state-of-the art computational approaches. Additionally, his research interest lies in the identification of brain tumor biomarkers using liquid biopsy approaches. Outside lab, he is entirely focused on cafe-hopping, traveling, photography, cooking and creative-writing.

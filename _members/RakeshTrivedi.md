Rakesh Trivedi is an American Brain Tumor Association (ABTA) postdoctoral fellow with training in computational biology. Before joining Dr. Bhatâ€™s laboratory in 2021, he earned his Ph.D. from the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) in Hyderabad, India. During his Ph.D., he developed a novel series of amino acid substitution scoring matrices specific to eukaryotic proteins enriched with disordered regions. His long-term research goal is to understand the brain cancer development and progression from genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics perspectives by implementing state-of-the art computational approaches. Additionally, his research interest lies in the identification of brain tumor biomarkers using liquid biopsy approaches. Outside lab, he is entirely focused on cafe-hopping, traveling, photography, cooking and creative-writing.

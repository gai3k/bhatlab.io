- Radiation resistance in glioma stemlike cells (GSCs). 
  This project investigates the mechanistic underpinnings of transcriptional plasticity and mesenchymal phenotype in GSCs and evaluates how these 
  traits contribute to radioresistance. New pharmacological inhibitors that block mesenchymal differentiation will also be tested as 
  radiosensitizers in mouse models of gliomas.
- Interaction of myeloid cells, cancer cells and the central nervous system.
  Dr. Bhat's lab uses single-cell multi-omics technologies to decipher the components of the brain tumor microenvironment. Mechanisms underlying   
  inflammation, phagocytosis in myeloid cells, and their role in regulating tumor growth are currently being studied along with information from 
  high-dimensional data.
- Developing liquid biopsies for brain cancer
  Dr. Bhat's lab is examining transcriptomic signatures from tumor-educated platelets and blood-derived cell-free DNA methylation patterns as a     
  liquid biopsy platform to monitor GBMs.
